I've always been a bit of a "running minimalist," or at least I liked to tell myself that. There's a certain zen in running "naked"—no watch, no music, just the sound of your own heavy breathing and the occasional judgment from a passing squirrel. But then I signed up for a 100k UTMB trail race.

Suddenly, "feeling the pace" felt a lot like "getting lost in the Alps at 3 AM." I needed data. I needed battery. And most importantly, I needed a watch that didn't die before I finished my morning coffee.

For years, my **Apple Watch SE (1st Gen)** was my faithful companion. It told me when I had emails (stressful), it tracked my steps to the fridge (impressive), and it looked sleek at the office. But as my training ramped up to 4 trails a week, the "low battery" chime became the soundtrack of my life. Entering a 15-hour race with a watch that gets nervous after 4 hours of GPS is like bringing a spoon to a knife fight. A very shiny, expensive spoon.

## Enter the COROS APEX 4

Switching to the **COROS APEX 4** felt like moving from a luxury sedan to a rugged mountain jeep. It's built with a titanium bezel and sapphire glass, which is great because I tend to "interact" with rocks more often than I'd like to admit. But the real game-changer? The battery.

> The APEX 4 doesn't just have a battery; it has a philosophy.

In its new _Endurance_ mode (which optimizes GNSS selection), this thing can outlast my willpower. For my 100k prep, I'll be out there for 13 to 15 hours. The Apple Watch would have retired, moved to Florida, and started playing bridge by hour six. The COROS? It'll still be asking me if I want to go for another lap.

## Data that Actually Helps (Not Just High Scores)

One thing I've had to accept: data helps you stay uninjured. The COROS ecosystem provides 6-month training plans that evolve at your own pace. As a Staff Engineer, I appreciate a good algorithm, and watching my _Training Load_ and _VFC (Heart Rate Variability)_ has kept me from nuking my legs when I should be resting.

It also added a speaker and a microphone, which is funny because now the watch can technically tell me to "slow down" out loud. It's like having a very calm, very persistent coach living on my wrist.

## The "Smart" vs. "Sport" Divide

Is the Apple Watch "better"? It depends on what you value. If you want to pay for groceries with your wrist and reply to texts while doing 800m repeats (why?), stay with Apple. But if you're staring down 100km of vertical gain and you want a tool that treats your training with the same seriousness as your IDE treats a production bug, the APEX 4 is in a different league.

The charger? I think I left it in a drawer somewhere. I haven't needed it in two weeks. And for a runner preparing for the biggest race of their life, that peace of mind is worth every gram of titanium.
