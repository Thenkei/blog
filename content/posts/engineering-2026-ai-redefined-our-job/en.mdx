New year, new paradigm. Not the kind of "new year, new me" that fades by February — the kind that permanently reshapes how you think about your job. 2026 is that year for software engineering.

At **RockFi**, we crossed a threshold we didn't fully anticipate. And looking back, I think it's worth naming it clearly: we stopped _writing_ code as our primary activity. We started _engineering_ at a different altitude.

## The Switch: From Cursor to Claude Code

A few months ago, our team made the call to move from Cursor to **Claude Code**. This wasn't a casual tooling swap. It was a deliberate bet on a workflow where the AI is not just a code completer, but an active collaborator embedded in the terminal, the repo, the context of the actual project.

The difference showed up fast.

Delivery improved. The team adopted it broadly, almost naturally — no mandate needed, no persuasion campaign. People saw the delta and migrated. The key shift wasn't speed alone. It was **leverage**. Claude Code understood our use cases in a way that reduced the constant translation overhead between "what I want" and "what I have to type."

> We don't write nearly as much code by hand as we used to. And yet we ship more. That sentence still sounds strange to say out loud.

## Internal Tooling That Changed the Game

One of the most impactful moves we made was building **custom internal tooling** layered on top of Claude Code. These aren't flashy — they're precise, opinionated tools built for the specific friction points of our team:

- **Workshop and brainstorming support** — structured prompts and context loaders that help the team explore ideas without losing the thread.
- **Dive In generator** — our label for deep technical documentation. The kind that used to take a senior engineer half a day to write and was always slightly outdated. Now it's generated alongside the work, not as an afterthought.
- **Story-to-PR pipelines** — we write the user stories, and the tool handles scaffolding the PR: branch, context, draft description, linked artifacts. The engineering overhead that used to tax every feature delivery just... evaporated.

This tooling didn't replace judgment. It eliminated the low-value friction that was silently draining energy from the team.

## Both Codex and Claude Code: A Personal Rhythm

Beyond the team's shared stack, on my side the setup evolved a bit differently. I'll be honest: I use both **Codex** and **Claude Code**, and I think that's the right call for how I work right now.

Codex is remarkably well-balanced for pure code generation. It's precise, it's focused, and it fits cleanly into short iteration loops. Claude Code brings the broader context management, the back-and-forth reasoning, the kind of depth you need for architecture decisions or debugging a gnarly distributed issue.

The combination unlocked something I didn't expect: I now work across **4 to 5 projects a day** in a way that actually feels manageable. Fixing an observability regression in one codebase, reviewing a schema migration in another, pushing my main project forward — all in the same day, without the context-switching tax becoming unbearable.

That's not multitasking. That's what async, AI-mediated work actually enables. Each project gets the attention it needs, when it needs it, because the cognitive ramp-up cost per context switch dropped dramatically.

## What Actually Changed

Let me be precise, because "AI makes us faster" is a boring take:

- **The unit of effort shifted.** We used to measure progress in lines of code. Now we measure it in problems solved, decisions made, and systems understood.
- **Junior engineers ramp faster.** The gap between someone new and someone experienced compressed because the LLM can carry a lot of the syntactic and boilerplate weight while the human focuses on intent.
- **Most of our time is now actual engineering.** Reading systems. Making tradeoffs. Designing. Reviewing for correctness. The work that was always the most valuable is now genuinely the majority of our work.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

There's a side of this worth naming: the bar for what counts as an "engineer's contribution" just moved. Typing fast never was the job, but it could mask not thinking clearly. That hiding place is gone.

If you're not sharpening your judgment, your ability to evaluate AI output, your instinct for what's correct versus what merely compiles — 2026 is going to be an uncomfortable year. The tools are extraordinary. The expectation on the human in the loop is higher, not lower.

## Let's Go

I wrote this from a place of genuine excitement, not hype. Our team is shipping at a pace and with a quality that would have seemed unrealistic eighteen months ago. The line between "thinking" and "building" blurred in the best possible way.

2026 redefined the job. The tools are here, the team is moving, and the only thing left is to keep raising the bar on what we do with them. I'm here for it.
