I am thrilled (and slightly terrified, in a good way) to announce my arrival at **RockFi** as a Staff Back-end Engineer! It marks a wild new step in my career, and I couldn't be more pumped about the mountains we're about to climb.

## A Look Back (How Did We Get Here?)

My career kicked off in the startup world at **Polymagine**, where I spent my days hacking together R&D for additive manufacturing and augmented reality. (Yes, making 3D things appear in thin air before it was cool). I then took a detour through **Michelin**, where I learned that the words "industrial production" and "scale" are not to be taken lightly.

In 2021, I joined **Forest Admin**, surviving four years of intense, glorious growth. I evolved from a Full Stack Engineer to a Staff Engineer, and eventually led a tech team as an Engineering Manager. We doubled the team size to over 20 engineers—mostly by sheer willpower and a lot of coffee.

## The Mission at RockFi

Now, at RockFi, my laser focus is on the **interconnection with key partners**. Basically, that means herding a chaotic stampede of complex client data into a beautifully centralized, real-time visualization of asset portfolios. It's a deep technical puzzle wrapped in a massive product value prop.

> "I have the ambition to help structure a technical team capable of responding to the very real, very complex challenges demanded by 'The new private management' revolution."

RockFi is reinventing private wealth management. And frankly, building the bulletproof technical foundations to support that vision is exactly the kind of trouble I want to get into.
