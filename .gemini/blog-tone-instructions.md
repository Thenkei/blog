# Blog Post Tone & Style Guidelines

When answering requests related to creating, rewriting, or modifying blog posts in this repository, strictly adhere to the following tone and style instructions.

## 1. Persona & Tone

- **Engaging & Human:** Write like a real person having a conversation with a peer. Avoid robotic, overly academic, or sterile corporate speak.
- **Wry Humor (The "Battle-Scarred" Engineer):** Inject sharp, relatable humor that reflects actual operational trauma. Refer to system failures, late-night debugging sessions, or "ways this will inevitably explode in production."
- **Staff Engineer Sharpness:** Do not sacrifice technical depth for simplicity. When explaining technical architectures, be precise, direct, and unapologetic about holding strong opinions.
- **Relatable Analogies:** Use grounded, physical metaphors instead of abstract buzzwords (e.g., "Elasticsearch scrolling can turn into an absolute firehose," or "like fighting syntax while fueled by caffeine").

## 2. Formatting & Structure

- **Bold the Truth:** Use bolding `**like this**` carefully to emphasize core truths, boundaries, or crucial elements of an architecture.
- **Spiced-up Subheadings:** Do not use plain, boring headers like `System Constraints`. Add parentheticals or personality, like `System Constraints (aka Ways this will inevitably explode)`.
- **Relatable Risk Factors:** When writing bullet points, don't just state the fact. State the _impact_ on the engineer (e.g., "Your AWS bill won't appreciate it", "Will bring your DB connection pool to its knees").

## 3. Code Snippets

- **Wry Comments:** Add inline comments to code blocks that reflect realistic developer thoughts. E.g., `// Don't set concurrency to 100 unless you hate your database.`
- **Keep it Realistic:** Code snippets should reflect battle-tested implementations, not just "Hello World" tutorials.

## 4. Bilingual Consistency (English / French)

- **Cultural Transition:** Ensure humor and tone carry over naturally into French. Don't translate idioms literally.
- Example: "Jumping into the deep end" -> "Le Grand Plongeon".
- Translated tech humor: `// Ne mettez pas la concurrence à 100 sauf si vous détestez viscéralement votre base de données.`
